## üå± How to start this project?

Create a new document to work with your partner to develop the instructions below. To facilitate collaborative work you can use [Google Presentations](slides.new) and then invite your partner via email to start working.

## üìù Instructions

### 1. Assemble your team and choose a layout.

Choose a partner to do this practice with and together select a distribution to study. There are many GNU/Linux operating system distributions, each with specific particularities and purposes.

While you can choose from the many that exist, here is a list of some of the most popular ones.

- Ubuntu
- RedHat
- Fedora
- PopOs
- Arch Linux
- ZorinOs
- Proxmox
- Rocky Linux
- RaspberryPi Os
- Manjaro
- Slackware
- Asahi Linux
- Open Suse
- CentOS Stream
- Gentoo
- Garuda Linux
- Kali
- Steam OS

You can see more distributions in [this article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions)

### 2. Prepare your presentation

Develop the following topics regarding your chosen distribution and prepare a presentation to share with the entire class. You should cover the following topics

- What distro it is based on
- Key features
- Intended use
- Packages
- Supported platforms
- Strengths (in terms of cybersecurity)
- Weaknesses (In terms of cybersecurity)

>üí° **Hint: Sites like [SlideCarnival](https://www.slidescarnival.com/) can help you with an elegant design ready to use, so you can focus more on content and less on aesthetic details.

### 3. Prepare your presentation

Present your work in front of your peers and compare with other distributions the aspects you consider most relevant. Keep an open mind to questions and observations from the group.

## üöõ How to deliver this project?

Once the presentation is ready, attach the URL to your 4geeks.com project. Don't forget to make the presentation public so that it can be reviewed.
